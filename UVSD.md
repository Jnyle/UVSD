## What is UVSD?

UVSD is a large dataset for UAV based vehicle detection and segmentation. UVSD contains 5,874 images with 98,600 instances with high quality instance-level semantic annotations, which are captured by drones in different places at different heights. In UVSD, part of pictures come from Vidrone, and the picture names from Visdrone dataset are saved in the file 'Visdrone.json'. Information about the Visdrone dataset can be found on the website: [Vision Meets Drones: A Challenge](http://www.aiskyeye.com/).
